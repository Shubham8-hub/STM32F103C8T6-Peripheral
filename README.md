## Multiple CAN

- In this project two blue pill are communicating with each other. In this repository the folder Bluepill1 and Bluepill2 are associated with it. 
- In both the Bluepill PA4 is connected to button and PA6 is connected to LED.
- When the Button of Bluepill1 is pressed the LED connected to the Bluepill2 is performing blinking operation as per the data send over the CAN bus, and viceversa.
